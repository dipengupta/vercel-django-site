# Dipen's Personal Website

So, this is a pretty basic personal website/portfolio, which was the result of a long weekend code jam. It was initially hosted on Heroku, but now it's on Vercel (which is getting painful to deploy on tbh)

The layout is pretty straightforward. It consists of the following pages:

- Home
- Personal
- Academic
- Music
- Contact

I'll probably keep updating this as and when big changes occur (~once a year atleast)
